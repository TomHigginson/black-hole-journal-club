### 2025-06-10: Tom
Discussed:
[RUBIES: A Spectroscopic Census of Little Red Dots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05459) (Hviding et al., 06-2025)
- JWST study of sample of 80 broad-lines sources selected from a detailed study of ~1500 AGN from the RUBIES NIRCAM/NIRSPEC/PRISM survey, z>3.1. A significant number (36) have the LRD-blue+red continuum, a point source at the core and broad emission lines.
- They find that all point sources with (spectroscopic) v-shaped continua exhibit broad Balmer lines where the data quality permits
detection, suggesting these properties are directly linked.

[The Onset of Feedback in Abell 1885: Evidence for Large-Scale Quenching Despite a Young Central AGN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03277) (White et al., 06-2025)
- TL;DR - An interesting paper that looks at a young AGN's core and extended environment ICM to suggest a lack of synchronisation between feeding and feedback timescales and suggests instead that heating effects can 'linger' possibly with turbulent mixing.
- Due to time constarints it will be discussed further on 2025-06-24

### 2025-05-20: Darius
Discussed papers:
[Electromagnetism as a purely geometric theory](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2987/1/012001) (Jussi Lindgren et al., 2025)
- Doesn't need scalers terms, they vanish by themselves
- Interesting interpretation of geometrical approaches to other forces beyond gravity
- Can solve some difficult to solve eqns. 
- Direct explanation of QM waves

[Possibility of Multi-Messenger Observations of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions with X-rays and Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10488) (Suzuguchi et al., 05-2025)
- Predicts only one joint X-ray and GW QPE detection during LISA's expected lifetime due to a small overlap in frequency detection.
- Sub-mHz GW detection would enhance these detections significantly.

[S241125n: Binary Black Hole Merger Produces Short GRB in AGN Disk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10395) (Zhang et al., 05-2025)
- A binary BH merger in an AGN with merger remnants accreting at hyper-Eddington rates.
- The observed GRB has a soft photon index is consistent with a jet inetracting with a dense AGN disk.
- A hard X-ray afterglow indicates strong absorption

[Black holes as gravitational mirrors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06018) (Santos et al., 05-2025)
- Interesting paper for a concept of retrolensing
- They show it is possible for photons to return to the same emission point after boomeranging around a BH
- They suggest the possibility of looking at planets using retrolensing

[Radiation and Magnetic Pressure Support in Accretion Disks around Supermassive Black Holes and The Physical Origin of the Extreme Ultraviolet to Soft X-ray Spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09671) (Jiang et al., 05-2025)
- Using models with realistic opacities and multi-group radiation transport of magnetically supported disks to find a peak around 10 eV.
[A XRISM Observation of the Archetypal Radio-Mode Feedback System Hydra-A: Measurements of Atmospheric Motion and Constraints on Turbulent Dissipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01494) (Rose et al., 05-2025)
- XRISM observations of Hydra-A jets and their power show they can supply the KE to the atmosphere to a degree that terbulent disuption would be unable to match
[Constraining gas motion and non-thermal pressure beyond the core of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster with XRISM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06533) (XRISM Collaboration, 05-2025)
- XRISM observations of the Abell 2029 cluster show non-thermal pressure accounts for less than 2% of the total pressure radii, decreasing with radius.
- Suggests deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium are small.
[XRISM spectroscopy on orbital modulation of Fe LyÎ± lines in Cygnus X-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09890) (Miura et al., 05-2025)
- XRISM specroscopy of HMXB Cygnus X-3 show emission lines can be linkde to the orbital motion and absorption lines to the stellar wind.
[Polarization Signatures of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Simulated Tilted, Truncated Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11446) (Fragile et al., 05-2025)
- From MC code Pandurata, a truncated AD can have individual spectra and polarization signatures whilst the tilt introduces inclination and azimuthal dependencies.
- Precession and oscillations introduce a time dependent signature. 

Presented paper:
[NuSTAR Detection of an Absorption Feature in ESP 39607: Evidence for an Ultra-fast Inflow?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07963) (Peca et al., 03-2025)
- Strong(?) evidence for real absorption feature and UF inflow
- Confidence is >4$$\sigma$$ (individually between $$2\sigma-3\sigma$$) for absorption considering it is found in two separate observations
- Inflow is ~$$0.125c$$ but data shows it could be either Fe-XXV or Fe-XXVI or a combination of both
- Not in 2010 observation so supports UF-inflow assumption
- Alternative is material launched outward without sufficient escape velocity. Or a failed-wind with a similar situation
- Look at possible not being an ultra-fast inflow (e.g. warm-hot IGM accretion) but seem to think this is unlikely. 
- Possible outflow of $$0.75c$$ of lighter materials (e.g. Calcium) but unlikely due to lower abundance.
- Conclude: best fit is UF-inflow. 
- In agreement with other UFI studies 
- Limitations of not having lower energies to fully test WHIM 

### 2025-05-13: Jiachen
[MeerKAT discovers a jet-driven bow shock near GRS 1915+105: How an invisible large-scale jet sculpts a microquasar's environment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17425) (Motta et al., 04-2025)
- Deepest ever radio L-band obervations (15hrs)
- Stellar mass BH jet energy dissipation is comparable to accretion energy through jet-ISM interactions and linked to SMBH
- Compressed material behind bow shock observed - reminiscent with Cyg X-1
- SF activity completely(?) unrelated. Old enough that previous jet activity could have triggered the SF.
- Jet induced feedback not just SMBH but also their stellar mass counter parts. Lots of energy can be released back into the environment 

Presented Paper(s)
[Quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions years after a nearby tidal disruption event](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08023-6#Abs1) (Nicholl et al., 10-2024)
- QPE in a dual X-ray Chandra-resolved source but not resolved in light curves. They believe QPE from the central galaxy source due to BB spectrum (of-centre source is PL)
- ~3yrs after TDE the QPE started. Essentially the TDE can form a disk and a second star can form the QPE
[Discovery of Quasi-periodic Eruptions in the Tidal Disruption Event and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter AT2022upj: implications for the QPE/TDE fraction and a connection to ECLEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19013v2) (Chakraborty et al., 04-2025)
- Probability of finding QPE from optical TDE, they find ~10%


### 2025-05-06: Arxiv
[Identifying intermediate mass binary black hole mergers in AGN disks using LISA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11721) (Dutta Roy et al., 03-2025):
- Binary with GW signature from merger 
- GW effected by star cluster & gas, almost insignificant contribution but could be detectable when imbedded in disk of significantly high density
- Therefore they should be detectable with LISA (but needs to be relatively near by ~few Mpc)
- Question: Do these objects exist (in the detectable universe)?
- LISA expected to detect order of 100s on 10yr timescale, many of which will be archival.
- Mass explained through BH mergers and and accretion within an AGN disk.

[Testing X-ray Reprocessing and Mapping the Soft Excess of NGC 7469 with NICER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20223) (Partington et al., 04-2025):
- Looking at a light curve between different wavebands for an AGN
- Thermal re-processing model for X-ray heating disk to give UV emission seen
- X-rays lead UV by less than a day
- Soft excess from reflection rather than warm corona? No lag between X-ray power law and soft excess
- Different results for long term (bins averaged over 20 days) variation compared to short term 

### 2025-04-29: Andy

- [Supermassive Black Holes in X-rays: From Standard Accretion to Extreme Transients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22791) (Kara & GarcÃ­a, 03-2025)

Discussed Papers:

[Disk winds spectral energy distribution and the variability timescale of AGN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19344) (Netzer, 04-2025)
- This paper may be of interest to some.
- Using a recent Mrk 817 observation, a model with a radial and time-dependant mass outflow rate has been observed.
- SED changes are more significant in X-rays than Optical.
- Overall link between time-dependent disk wings, SED, thermal timescale and Optical-UV variability

[A Sandwich Model for Changing-Look AGNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17246) (Ma, 04-2025)
- A multi-disk accretion disk to model CLAGNs. An optical thick disk in the centre, sandwiched between two optically thin disks.
- The central disk can have increased velocity and thus lower accretion timescales.
- The system (specifically thin disk) can resemble a warm corona when dominated by the magnetic pressure and produce the soft excess, and when this isn't the case, it can resemble a hot corona and show a shorter accretion timescale.

[OGLE-2011-BLG-0462: An Isolated Stellar-mass Black Hole Confirmed Using New HST Astrometry and Updated Photometry](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adbe6e) (Sahu et al., 04-2025)
- A set of observations over roghly 11 years for a microlensing event
- A ~7 $$M_\odot$$ isolated BH ~1.5 kpc away moving at ~50 km $$\text{s}^{-1}$$ relative to background stars.
- Possible that the velocity is due to a natal kick from its SNe

Presented Paper:

[A consistent radio to sub-mm pc-scale study of the Nucleus of NGC 1068](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20303) (Mutie, 03-2025)
- From observations over ~10 years (and much older VLA data) an SED of the central (~pc) region of NGC 1068 been found to fit a model with synchrotron, free-free, dust and coronal components.
- The sub-mm excess suggests synchrotron emission from a compact and optically thick corona with $$R_c \approx 70 R_g$$, $$\sim 10%$$ of energy density in non-thermal electrons and $$B\approx148$$ G.
- There is also a possible clumpy gas absorber to explain the curvy SED.


### 2025-04-22: Arxiv & Discussion

[Jet properties of FR0 radio galaxies: need for VLBI data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03787) (Baldi et al., 01-2025)
- Looks at FR0
- Mildly relativistic jet bulk speed, lower compared to FRIs and FRIIs
- Negligible relativistic beaming
- SMBH Spin keping jets compact

Question on trapped photon orbits:
- Geodesic photon rings - possible closed orbits do not necessarily take into affect the wave nature of photons
- Possible expectation of processing and unstable closed orbits
- No spin requriement to be able to generate a closed/null orbit

[An interstellar mission to test astrophysical black holes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14576) (Bambi, 04-2025)
- Possiblity of inetrstellar mission to send a probe to the nearest BH
- Seems generally far-fetched with some back-of-the-envolope calculations but nevertheless an interesting paper on something that is not impossible.

- Interesting paper looking at companion systems around AGN

[Jet properties of FR0 radio galaxies: need for VLBI data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03787) (Baldi et al., 01-2025)
- A very brief conference preceding that looks at FR0 parsec-scale jets, slower than those of FRI and FRII jets. Potential explanation from a SMBH low prograde spin or low magnetic fields limiting structure.

[On the Extremely X-ray Variable Active Galactic Nuclei in the XMM-LSS Field](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20556) (Zhang et al., 03-2025)
- Looks at variable AGNs in the XMM-LSS field. 
- They have some very nice SEDs and observations from Chandra (ACIS-S), XMM (pn, M1 and M2,), eROSITA and optical/IR. 
- It looks like they only find 1 changing look and a few general variability AGNs with changing obscuration the leading contender to explain it.

Presented Paper:
[Temperature Profiles of Accretion Disks in Luminous Active Galactic Nuclei derived from Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20023) (Son et al., 02-2025)
- Using optical/UV variability data to constrain accretion disk model
- SDSS data to fit optical/UV light to accretion disk
- In the $$\tau \propto L^a \lambda_{RF}^b$$, they find $$b$$ much lower than expected - consisten with some other studies.
- Time lags for different wavelengths are a proxy for disk size
- AD well fit by broken power law, variability amplitude increases with timescale and flattens above characterisitic timescale, $$\tau$$.
- $$\tau$$ corresponds to thermal timescale.
- SDSS- reverbaration model project. Broadline photomoetry improved with spectroscopic monitoring.
- Compute a structure function from time lag and variability
- In order to fit $$\tau \propto L^a \lambda_{RF}^b$$ (generated from Shakura & Sunyaev model) they assume SF follows universal function when in units of $\tau$
- Slim disk and radially inefficient accretion flows have no significant impact
- Balmer continuum isn't origin of colour profile
- SF well fit but disagreement with Shakura & Sunyaev model
- spectroscopic data more robust than just photometric data
- Overall a bit of a mystery still.
- Structure function model in [Modelling the Multiwavelength Variability of Mrk 335 using Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06838) (Griffiths et al., 07-2021) with gaussian processes.

- JWST and Keck observations
- Chandra X-rays fill the apparent open cone.
- AGN core in polarised light, X-rays highly obscured $$N_H \sim 10^{23} \text{cm}^{-2}$$.
- Hot dust in inner torus produce continuum at $$>2\mu \text{m}$$ 
- 94 ionized emission lines - consistent with AGN photoionization
- Radio jet clearing and emptying cone
- Quickly-moving [Fe-II] clump in western cone
- Outflow $$<V>\sim 250\text{km s}^{-1}$$
- Clump may be line of sight - high velocity absorption lines
- High velocity could be due to radiation pressure in centre
- [Fe-II] clump has $$\sim 40M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$$ and mass $$1.1\times10^8$$
- Velocity field, spiral outflow models show rotating cone around radio axis.
- Line splitting in model
- Spiral Outflow: AGN/jet driven or residual roation from infalling gas
- AGN/jet driven model needs a secondary driving force to maintain velocity - unlikely?
- residual rotation requires puffed-up disk (e.g. Muhkerjee+2018). Disk velocity needs sub-keplerian but not observed.

Discused Papers:
Not enough time to go through them so they will be discussed briefly next week

Presented Paper: [Multi-wavelength observations of a jet launch in real time from the post-changing-look Active Galaxy 1ES 1927+654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02340) (Laha, et al., 01-2025)
Slides available here: [Gloria_Raharimbolamena_Preprint_04_Feb_25.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18768324/Gloria_Raharimbolamena_Preprint_04_Feb_25.pdf)


- Jet launch mechanism from a Changing-look AGN
- Rapid accretion mode
- 1ES1927+654, QPO activity.
  - Acts differently to other AGN. No optical-UV correlation from flares
  - Object has 'true type II AGN pre-outburst'
- Steep initial spectrum of $$\Gamma\sim2.4$$
- Steepening power law during flaring (reaching $$\Gamma>3$$ during radio flaring)
- Indications of sources other than UV accretion
- Soft excess increasing in flux
- Blackbody model best fits the soft excess
- No significant Optical or UV variability
- High colimation suggest Blanford-Zanjek (BZ) lauch mechanism (Using BH roational energy)
- Outflow speeds suggest $$0.2c$$, a BP mechanism would need launch distance $$<10r_g$$. Low speed for BZ, could indicate inclination angle
- Kinetic power of jet suggests near 100% efficiency of BZ.
- Magnetic field well above equiparition
- Origin of new soft excess is unique and not found in RQ-AGN. Possibly due to magnetic energy & jet emission
- The (near-)concurance of QPO and jet signals shows similarities with BH binaries
- Radio flare delay due to a screen of hot gas
- This type of QPO acitivity never observed in AGN.

- Radio observations reveal low polarization degree but assumed from beam depolarization and therefore ignored in this study.
- SNe feedback, AGN  & Galactic winds to explain some soft excess
- Reduction with [SAUNAS pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01625) (Borlaff et al., 05-2024) which includeds standard reduction, PSF modelling and deconvolution and low surface brightness estimations.
- Included in SUNAS is bootstrapping and MC simulations for error estimation and Voronoi binning.
- NGC 5085 is at $$z=$$ so $$20 kpc \sim 2.9"$$
- $$5\sigma$$ detection of emission perpendicular to galaxy.
- $$3\sigma$$ detection parallel to disk of galaxy
- Highly inclinated circumnuclear disk
- Jet changing orientation of $$\sim90\deg$$ possibly but unlikely? Would likely need external influence (mergers)
- fig 8. shows nice cartoon of potential causes for a change of orientation
- Outflow appears to have stopped. Stellar population should be young but blue emission not seen
- Stellar age is $$>Gyr$$
- Binary SMBH
- Potential causes for X-shaped emission: AGN re-orientation, overpressurised coccoon or faded starburst.

  - Weakly correlated X-ray & UV light curves -> Problematic for the standard Reverberation Mapping models
  - Mechanisms could be instrinsic uv-optical variability in disk
  - Model turbulance & cross-sections
  - Line opacity can affect models
  - ATHENA++ code
  - Intensity set by lightcurve

  - Variability driven by AGN disk
  - Higher order models with different reprocessing ratios could be a better fit
  - Test 1 day time lag: reconstained 1 day lag from JAVILIN method

Discussed Papers:
Not necessarily discussed in great detail but mentioned were:
  - [Impact of radiative cooling on the magnetised geometrically thin accretion disk around Kerr black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09698) (Dihingia et al., 05-2023)
  - [A simplified approach for reproducing fully relativistic spectra in X-ray binary systems: Application to Cygnus X-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02415) (Papavasileiou et al., 08-2024)

Presented: 
[Fifty Years After the Discovery of the First Stellar-Mass Black Hole: A Review of Cyg X-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12507) (Jiang, 11-2024)
- Cyg X-1 is 1st known Stellar Mass BH known and hosts $20 M_\odot$ BH with $40 M_\odot$ companion star. One of a few High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB)
- Review goes through physics beind measurements in useful detail.
- BH-BH merger candiadate
- First instance of HMXB using typical AGN models
- 3% probability to observe BH > $35 M_{\odot}$ and 0.6% of HMXB GW source within hubble time.
- Harder X-ray for low luminosity states
- Disk emissivity profile indicates compact corona (~5-7 $r_g$) but still unknown geometry.
- Over-polarise, expected 1% but found 4%, this suggests a higher material speed and thus higher scattering cross-section. The jet may also help produce these observations.
- polarisation aligns with radio jet over AU scales.
- Corona geometries are source dependent and testing models should not rule out other models.
- Polarisation angle changes at higher energies. Possibly higher polarisation degree for emission closer to BH, consistent with very high BH spin.
- Fe lines seen in LMXB are not seen in Cyg X-1
- Emmission above 511 keV constarined by pair-production and produces a peak, the annihilation line is always present in Cyg X-1 models. Doppler broadening allows for higher $e^-$ temperature.
- Non-thermal emission from jet and corona
- In the high density model, free-free absorption is important.

Presented paper:
- [The Study of Jet Formation Mechanism in Fermi Blazars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11373) (Xie et al., 2024)
  - Presentation slides are available [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17993281/Gloria_Raharimbolamena_Preprint_03_Dec_24.pdf)
  - A study of 937 Blazars studied for jet formation mechanisms
  - Jet power could come from the rotational energy of BH (BZ mdoel) or AD (BP model)
  - Study finds no significant relationship between jet power and accretion rate. Possible week relationship for FSQR
  - Adding BH mass gets stronger relationship (using F-test)
  - BH more important in fueling jets than AD
  - Neitehr BZ or BP fully explain jet-powering of blazars but $P_{jet}$ observations are difficult.
  - FSRQ from BP (not BZ sufficient), BL Lacs could be BZ model
  - BL Lacs ADAF dominated, for FSRQs standard disk dominates.
  - BZ MAD disk model in BL Lacs

### 2024-11-26: Fergus
Presented paper:
- [On the Morphology of Relativistically Broadened Line Emission from Axisymmetric Equatorial Accretion Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14338) (Gates et al., 2024)
  - Uses geometrically thin, equatorial disk models & describes how to determine emission line morphologies from redshift and accretion disk patterns.
  - Very interesting figures, Fig 1 maps different redshifted emission within in the disk to structure of emission line.
  - Looks at an infinitely far outer disk radius (removing outer-outer and outer-inner paths) then at finite outer disk radius.
  - Critical points dictating central regions
  - Also compared different disk models: "Cunningham" model (with inter-ISCO contributions), and non-Keplerian (towards slim-disc) models, but keeping the same geometry. Overall effect of Cunningham model can be large depending on inclination, but for non-Keplerian is a stretching of the location of the critical values.
  - Red-tail could overestimate very high BH spin if material is not inside the ISCO
  - Changing keplarian factor by $5\%$ can change line profile features, but more pronounced at blueshifted side.

- [X-Ray View of Little Red Dots: Do They Host Supermassive Black Holes?](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...969L..18A/abstract) (Ananna, et al., 2024)
  - Unknown reason for JWST-observed 'little red dots', with flux either AGN dominated, young star formation dominated or both.
  - Over 100 Chandra observations of lensing cluster Abell 2744 equating up to $\approx 2$ Ms or $\approx90$ Ms stacked.
  - No significant detection until broad-line $H\alpha$ galaxies are stacked.
  - Possibly Compton thick AGN to explain non-detections.

  - LRDs likely either do not contain overmassive SMBHs or accrete at a low eddington rate.
- Also discussed was [UNCOVER Spectroscopy Confirms the Surprising Ubiquity of Active Galactic Nuclei in Red Sources at z > 5](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...964...39G/abstract) (Greene, et al., 2024)
