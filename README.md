## Minutes

### 2024-11-26: Fergus
Presented paper:
- [On the Morphology of Relativistically Broadened Line Emission from Axisymmetric Equatorial Accretion Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14338) (Gates et al., 2024)
  - Uses geometrically thin, equatorial disk models & describes how to determine emission line morphologies from redshift and accretion disk patterns.
  - Very interesting figures, Fig 1 maps different redshifted emission within in the disk to structure of emission line.
  - Looks at an infinitely far outer disk radius (removing outer-outer and outer-inner paths) then at finite outer disk radius.
  - Critical points dictating central regions
  - Also compared different topologies for disk models (standard model and Cunningham model - latter changes critical values)
  - Red-tail could overestimate very high BH spin if material is not inside the ISCO
  - Changing keplarian factor by $5\%$ can change line profile features, but more pronounced at blueshifted side.

  - Really nice detailed spectrum with a lot of Fe absorption and emission lines observed.

Presented paper:
- [X-Ray View of Little Red Dots: Do They Host Supermassive Black Holes?](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...969L..18A/abstract) (Ananna, et al., 2024)
  - Unknown reason for JWST-observed 'little red dots', with flux either AGN dominated, young star formation dominated or both.
  - Over 100 Chandra observations of lensing cluster Abell 2744 equating up to $\approx 2$ Ms or $\approx90$ Ms stacked.
  - No significant detection until broad-line $H\alpha$ galaxies are stacked.
  - Possibly Compton thick AGN to explain non-detections.
  - Results from X-ray and NIR suggest scaling relations from virial relations may not be applicable at high redshift.
  - LRDs likely either do not contain overmassive SMBHs or accrete at a low eddington rate.
- Also discussed was [UNCOVER Spectroscopy Confirms the Surprising Ubiquity of Active Galactic Nuclei in Red Sources at z > 5](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...964...39G/abstract) (Greene, et al., 2024)
