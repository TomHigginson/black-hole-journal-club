This has a preliminary schedule for Journal Clubs for the next academic year, when teaching days are confirmed we can find a day and time that works for everyone.
If you would like to join this Journal Club please email: thomas.higginson@bristol.ac.uk and use the subject: "BH Journal Club".

We meet every Tuesday at:

- **15:00 until 16:15 (UTC + 0)**

The Zoom link has been emailed to the group.

## Agenda

- Presentation of chosen paper (~30 mins)
- Discussion
- Other papers from the week

Discussed papers:

Belinda's paper
- Paper on looking at different parameters to probe bolomentric correction (total luminosity)
- Based on fact from Intrinsic from IR to UV

Presented:

Darius's Paper
- Seyfert PG 1426+015 - almost zero galactic absorption evident
- Near Consistent flux, HR changes a little
- Possible anti-correlation for HR and flux
- OVII emission seen, otherwise it appears completely absorption free in RGS data
- Relativistically broadened Fe line
- Broken Power law appears to be a better fit than Lamppost model at higher energies
- XILVER model has weaker soft excess than REFLIONX, due to the returned densities being different (XILVER is lower) and XILVER has lower free-free contribution
- Assume same OVIII abundance but XILVER has a higher emission
- XILVER model appears to pivot the power law due to the OVIII flux which leads to a poorer fit to the hard component
- Allowing a weaker OVIII would allow for XILVER to fit the model better
- XILVER does not seem to accurately treat opacities in the AD which could cause the higher line flux in the model meaning it can be plausible to add absorption to the OVIII
- REFLIONX treats the line emission as an escape fraction which can lead to a more realisitic model
- XILVER prefers a higher BH spin of $$\sim 0.95$$ whereas REFLIONX prefers a more intermediate spin $$>0.7$$
- Model AD to ISCO but do not place strong constrains
- Largest Reverberation-mapped mass: $$log(M_{BH}/M_\odot) = 9$$
- High density AD $$n_e\sim10^{18}$$
- S/N not sufficient to constrain iron line and compton hump
