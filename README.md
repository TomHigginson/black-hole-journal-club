### 2025-01-07: Jiachen
Discussed Papers:
Not necessarily discussed in great detail but mentioned were:
  - [Impact of radiative cooling on the magnetised geometrically thin accretion disk around Kerr black hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09698) (Dihingia et al., 05-2023)
  - [A simplified approach for reproducing fully relativistic spectra in X-ray binary systems: Application to Cygnus X-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02415) (Papavasileiou et al., 08-2024)

Presented: 
[Fifty Years After the Discovery of the First Stellar-Mass Black Hole: A Review of Cyg X-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12507) (Jiang, 11-2024)
- Cyg X-1 is 1st known Stellar Mass BH known and hosts $20 M_\odot$ BH with $40 M_\odot$ companion star. One of a few High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB)
- Review goes through physics beind measurements in useful detail.
- BH-BH merger candiadate
- First instance of HMXB using typical AGN models
- 3% probability to observe BH > $35 M_{\odot}$ and 0.6% of HMXB GW source within hubble time.
- Harder X-ray for low luminosity states
- Disk emissivity profile indicates compact corona (~5-7 $r_g$) but still unknown geometry.
- Over-polarise, expected 1% but found 4%, this suggests a higher material speed and thus higher scattering cross-section. The jet may also help produce these observations.
- polarisation aligns with radio jet over AU scales.
- Corona geometries are source dependent and testing models should not rule out other models.
- Polarisation angle changes at higher energies. Possibly higher polarisation degree for emission closer to BH, consistent with very high BH spin.
- Fe lines seen in LMXB are not seen in Cyg X-1
- Emmission above 511 keV constarined by pair-production and produces a peak, the annihilation line is always present in Cyg X-1 models. Doppler broadening allows for higher $e^-$ temperature.
- Non-thermal emission from jet and corona
- In the high density model, free-free absorption is important.


### 2024-12-10: Arxiv

We very briefly mentioned some of the papers that were lightly discussed last week although not in great detail:

- [New Insights with XRISM & Cloudy: A novel Column Density Diagnostic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15357) (Gunasekera et al., 11-2024)

We discussed a few other papers in a little more detail.
- [Feedback from Intermediate Mass Black Holes on Dwarf Galaxy Morphology at z = 2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06495) (Bi et al., 12-2024)
  - Looking at IMBHs with AGN feedback influencing gas fraction, SF and galaxy structrue.
  - Potential need for low-z diagnostics for high-z. 
  - Also looked at JWST pixelation effects.

  - Looking at masses of AGN compared to the stellar mass and different ratios.
  - Investigates direct collapse black holes.
 
- [Lack of Rest-frame UV Variability in Little Red Dots Based on HST and JWST Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05242) (Tee et al., 12-2024)
  - V-shaped SEDs appear less variable
  - Possible heavy AGN obsuration
  - No variability suggests stellar contributions

- [Probing orbits of stellar mass objects deep in galactic nuclei with quasi-periodic eruptions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11190) (Zhou et al., 05-2024)
  - useful figures
  - QPEs from TDE & stellar mass object collisions

### 2024-12-03: Gloria
Presented paper:
- [The Study of Jet Formation Mechanism in Fermi Blazars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11373) (Xie et al., 2024)
  - Presentation slides are available [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17993281/Gloria_Raharimbolamena_Preprint_03_Dec_24.pdf)
  - A study of 937 Blazars studied for jet formation mechanisms
  - Jet power could come from the rotational energy of BH (BZ mdoel) or AD (BP model)
  - Study finds no significant relationship between jet power and accretion rate. Possible week relationship for FSQR
  - Adding BH mass gets stronger relationship (using F-test)
  - BH more important in fueling jets than AD
  - Neitehr BZ or BP fully explain jet-powering of blazars but $P_{jet}$ observations are difficult.
  - FSRQ from BP (not BZ sufficient), BL Lacs could be BZ model
  - BL Lacs ADAF dominated, for FSRQs standard disk dominates.
  - BZ MAD disk model in BL Lacs
 
Other papers:
- [X-ray polarization from accretion disk winds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18299) (Nitindala et al., 2024)

### 2024-11-26: Fergus
Presented paper:
- [On the Morphology of Relativistically Broadened Line Emission from Axisymmetric Equatorial Accretion Disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14338) (Gates et al., 2024)
  - Uses geometrically thin, equatorial disk models & describes how to determine emission line morphologies from redshift and accretion disk patterns.
  - Very interesting figures, Fig 1 maps different redshifted emission within in the disk to structure of emission line.
  - Looks at an infinitely far outer disk radius (removing outer-outer and outer-inner paths) then at finite outer disk radius.
  - Critical points dictating central regions
  - Also compared different disk models: "Cunningham" model (with inter-ISCO contributions), and non-Keplerian (towards slim-disc) models, but keeping the same geometry. Overall effect of Cunningham model can be large depending on inclination, but for non-Keplerian is a stretching of the location of the critical values.
  - Red-tail could overestimate very high BH spin if material is not inside the ISCO
  - Changing keplarian factor by $5\%$ can change line profile features, but more pronounced at blueshifted side.
